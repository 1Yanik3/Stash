# Stash

I used to use [Raindrop](raindrop.io) for managing a lot of files as it has good tag functionality, however I ran into limitations, a lack of polish of features I cared about, and a general slowness of the entire application (to be fair, I don't think it was designed for this).

This prompted me to create my own solution, more tailored to my personal needs: So I came up with this.

Stash is my personal system for managing all kinds of media (currently made for images and video, might be expanded for audio and other things in the future).

This is a big project for me, but also one that is going to take a long long time to be finished (if it will ever be finished). Please note, that because of that I may open source this project, but if you want to setup this project yourself you will probably have to do some minor code changes (like changing some hard coded things, ...).
